# BellSchedule
A GUI interface for a programmatic bell schedule

This program (when complete) will allow a user to set up a series of bell schedules and deploy the selected schedule with as few clicks as possible.

Schedules will be user created, saved, and deployed.

Programming to be done in Python, because it is the best solution for this issue (specifically because it is the only language I know anything about).
